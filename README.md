**File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️ & Error Handling Lab** 🧪
📌 Description

This project demonstrates how to read, modify, and write files in Python, while also practicing error handling.
It is divided into two main parts:

File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️

Reads from input.txt

Modifies the content (default: makes text uppercase)

Saves the modified content into output.txt

If input.txt doesn’t exist, the program will create it automatically with a default introduction text.

Error Handling Lab 🧪

Asks the user to type a filename

If the file exists → displays its content

If the file doesn’t exist → shows a friendly error message

If permissions are missing → shows a warning

If something unexpected happens → shows the error safely

🚀 Outcomes

By running this project, you will learn:

How to read and write files in Python

How to modify text content before saving it

How to gracefully handle errors such as missing files

How to build robust programs that don’t crash unexpectedly
